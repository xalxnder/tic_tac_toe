# Tic-Tac-Toe
In my learning python journey, I thought it would be a fun challenge to create a command line version of Tic Tac Toe. Will anybody ever play this? Probably not :). 

### To-Do 

[]- Add functionality to check for a DRAW.
[]- Check if user's input is equal to one of the possible moves.
